# This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.
#
# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS
# dictionary. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s
# compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a
# single word.
#
# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.
